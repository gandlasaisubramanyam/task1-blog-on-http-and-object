What is HTTP/1.1 ?

    HTTP 1.1 is the latest version of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
   the World Wide Web application protocol that runs on top of the Internet's TCP/IP suite of protocols.
   HTTP 1.1 provides faster delivery of Web pages than the original HTTP and reduces Web traffic.

What is the use of HTTP2?

    HTTP/2 enables full request and response multiplexing. 
   In practice, this means a connection made to a web server from your browser,
   can be used to send multiple requests and receive multiple responses. 
   This gets rid of a lot of the additional time,
   that it takes to establish a new connection for each request.


DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP/1.1 VS HTTP/2 ?

   Because HTTP/1.1 relies on the transport layer to avoid buffer overflow,
   each new TCP connection requires a separate flow control mechanism.

   HTTP/2, however, multiplexes streams within a single TCP connection, 
   and will have to implement flow control in a different manner.
